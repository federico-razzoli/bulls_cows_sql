# Bulls and Cows SQL

This is the popular Bulls and Cows game, implemented in MariaDB using the stored procedures.

To install this program:

`mysql -uroot -p<your_pwd> < bulls_cows.sql`

Type `CALL help()` to get a brief explaination about the game.

I suspect that Mr Codd didn't elaborate the relational theory to let people play games.
Oh, well, he would probably appreciate.
